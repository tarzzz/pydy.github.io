Potential Mentoring Organizations
=================================

This is a list of organizations that PyDy students may be able to work with and
apply to for a GSoC position:

  * `SymPy <https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/sympy>`_
    SymPy Mechanics is the core of the PyDy workflow and software. We will
    continue to work with them for the symbolic side of our system.
  * `Portland State University <https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/portland_state>`_
    Portland State hosts various academic related projects.  They funded the
    first year of PyDy's development.
  * `Python Software Foundation <https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/python>`_
    PSF is an umbrella org that can host varous projects in the Python
    ecosystem.
  * `The Open Motion Planning Library <https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/ompl>`_
    These guys do robotics. PyDy could be super useful for them to have
    correctly derived dynamics.
  * `Blender Foundation <https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/blender>`_
    Blender can be linked with a physics engine to driving animations of
    complex scenes.
  * `BRL-CAD <https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/brlcad>`_
    A physics backend can add dynamic simulation capabilities BRL-CAD. Many CAD
    packages offer this.
  * `Crystal Space <https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/crystalspace>`_
    Crystal space is a 3D engine with some ragdoll physics capabilities.  PyDy
    could utilize their infastructure to give precision dynamic simulations.
  * `MoveIt! <https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/moveit>`_
    Moveit needs motion planning for there system. PyDy can provide precise
    kinematics for them.
  * `OGRE <https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/ogre>`_
    OGRE is a 3D engine. PyDy could utilize OGRE to visualize simulations.
  * `Open Source Robotics Foundation <https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/osrf>`_
    The OSRF utilizes Gazebo which is based on Bullit. This software could be
    enhance by PyDy's more capable and advanced simulation capabilities.
  * `Processing <https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/processing>`_
    PyDy could utilize processing for visualization.
  * `RoboComp <https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/robocomp>`_
    Robotics framework that could potentially utilize PyDy for maniplutor
    dynamics and control.
  * `Sage <https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/sage>`_
    Sage is a general purpose tool for scientific computing. The Sage system
    and notebook could be used as a platform for PyDy because most of the
    elements for PyDy's vision are already in Sage.
