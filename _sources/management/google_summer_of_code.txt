Google Summer of Code
---------------------

The development of SymPy Mechanics, the core of the PyDy workflow, has been
graciously supported by Google's Summer of Code in the past. This page
documents the previous grants and gives an outline of what you can do if you'd
like to apply for a Google Summer of Code project based around development of
SymPy Mechanics or other aspects of the PyDy workflow.

Past Awards
^^^^^^^^^^^


*  Luke Peterson (2009)
   `Final Report <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2009-PyDy-Report>`_:
   Luke implemented the 
   `first version of the PyDy workflow <http://code.google.com/p/pydy/>`_ in
   the standalone PyDy package. It included symbolic equation of motion
   generation, simulation, and animation.

*  Gilbert Gede (2011) 
   `[Application] <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2011-Application-Gilbert-Gede:-PyDy>`_
   `[Blog] <http://gilbertgede.wordpress.com/>`_: Gilbert rewrote the symbolic
   engine for PyDy and included it in SymPy as the **mechanics** package.

*  Angadh Nanjangud (2012)
   `[Application] <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-2012-Application-Angadh-Nanjangud:-sympy.physics.mechanics>`_
   `[Blog] <http://angadhsympy.wordpress.com/>`_: Angadh extended Gilbert's
   work with symoblic Lagrangian dynamics.

Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First check out the resources at Google to see what the GSoC is all about:


*  `General GSoC info <https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/>`_

*  `2013 GSoC Site <http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013>`_

Since PyDy is a collection of projects, you can potentially get support and
mentorship through a number of mentoring orgainzations. The main project to
start looking at is SymPy, as the core mechanics package is developed under its
wing. The SymPy wiki has an abundance of pages on the GSoC including past
applications. Also check out the main SymPy website for general information
about the software.


*  `SymPy Wiki <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki>`_

*  `Sympy.org <http://sympy.org>`_

*  `Mechanics Documentation <http://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/physics/mechanics/index.html>`_

Check out some of our ideas and roadmap for PyDy (including SymPy mechanics):

Get on the mailing lists and IRC, introduce yourself, and start asking
questions. The sooner you join the lists and the more questions you ask, the
better:


*  `PyDy mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pydy>`_

*  `SymPy mailing list <https://groups.google.com/group/sympy>`_

*  SymPy on freenode: #sympy

*  PyDy on freenode: #pydy

Applicants will need to submit a proposal to the sponsor organization, most
likely SymPy. Each organization may have different application processes. The
PyDy team can help you refine your proposal and prepare your application, but
you have to initiate it. Getting our attention early and showing that you
really care by doing is the best way to get our support and help.

Steps To Success
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 #.  Review the information on `pydy.org <http://pydy.org>`_ and the
     `GSoC website <http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013>`_ to
     see if a project under PyDy looks right for you.
 #.  Introduce yourself on the PyDy mailing list. Tell us who you are, why you
     think you'd be a good candidate, and what you may want to work on.
 #.  Install Git, make a Github account, install Python and/or additionally the
     SciPy Stack, and clone the SymPy repository. Try out some example
     problems using the mechanics package and generally get familiar with the
     tools and code. Adding your favorite dynamics example to the
     `pydy_examples <https://github.com/PythonDynamics/pydy_examples>`_
     repository and/or this wiki is a great starting point. 
 #.  Through engagement on the PyDy email list the project team will help you
     choose a realistic scope for your potential GSoC work. The team will also
     guide you towards an appropriate mentor organization for your project
     idea. This will most likely be SymPy, but depending your project it may
     fit better with other mentor organizations. **It is up to you to initiate
     all conversation with the project team.**
 #.  Once a mentor organization is selected, get familiar with the mentor
     organization's application process. Most organizations require you to
     write a written proposal detailing your project, timeline, and goals.
     Most also require that you submit a patch to the software code base to be
     considered. The sooner you start on all of this, the better.
 #.  Engage with both the PyDy project team and the selected mentoring
     organization to refine your proposal before Google's May 3rd deadline.
 #.  Submit your final application to the Google Summer of Code Melange website
     on May 3rd and cross your fingers!
